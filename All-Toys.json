        "description": "The body of a Barbie doll is typically made from high-quality plastic, which provides the doll with a solid structure. This plastic is designed to be lightweight, allowing for easy manipulation and play. It also ensures that the doll can withstand regular use without easily breaking or warping. The head of a Barbie doll is made from a softer, more flexible plastic to allow for realistic facial features and expressions. The eyes, eyebrows, lips, and other facial details are often painted onto the plastic to enhance the doll's appearance. Barbie dolls have rooted hair made from synthetic fibers, such as nylon or kanekalon. This hair can be styled and brushed like real hair, providing endless possibilities for imaginative play. The hair is attached to the scalp using various methods, including glue or small plugs inserted into the head. The clothing and accessories of Barbie dolls are crafted from fabric and other materials. These garments are often designed with attention to detail, featuring stitching, buttons, zippers, and other elements to mimic real-life clothing. Accessories such as shoes, purses, and jewelry are typically made from plastic or metal."
